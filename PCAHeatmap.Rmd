### PCA Heatmap

In particular PCHeatmap allows for easy exploration of the primary sources of heterogeneity in a dataset, and can be useful when trying to decide which PCs to include for further downstream analyses. Both cells and genes are ordered according to their PCA scores. Setting cells.use to a number plots the ‘extreme’ cells on both ends of the spectrum, which dramatically speeds plotting for large datasets. Though clearly a supervised analysis, we find this to be a valuable tool for exploring correlated gene sets.

```{r PCAHeatmap}
PCHeatmap(object = obj, pc.use = 1, cells.use = 500, do.balanced = TRUE, label.columns = FALSE)
```

### Heatmaps by PCs

```{r PCHeatmaps}
PCHeatmap(object = obj, 
          pc.use = 1:12, 
          cells.use = 500, 
          do.balanced = TRUE, 
          label.columns = FALSE, 
          use.full = FALSE)
```
